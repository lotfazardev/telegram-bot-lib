/**
 * Represents reaction changes on a message with anonymous reactions.

 * This object is used to track changes in reactions to a message in a chat, specifically when the reactions are anonymous.
 * The reactions are represented as counts of the different reaction types that have been applied to the message.
 *
 * @see {@link Chat} for the chat containing the message
 * @see {@link ReactionCount} for the structure of individual reaction counts
 *
 * @example
 * const reactionUpdate: MessageReactionCountUpdated = {
 *   chat: someChat, // The chat where the message is located
 *   message_id: 123456, // Unique identifier for the message
 *   date: 1678765412, // Date of the change in Unix time
 *   reactions: [
 *     { reaction: "üëç", count: 10 }, // 10 thumbs up reactions
 *     { reaction: "‚ù§Ô∏è", count: 5 }, // 5 heart reactions
